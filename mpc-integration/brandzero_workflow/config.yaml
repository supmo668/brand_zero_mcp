  QUERY_GENERATOR: |
    You are an expert in consumer research. Your task is to generate {simulate_queries_count} search queries that a typical consumer would use to find information related to {brand_or_product}.
    IMPORTANT: Do not mention {brand_or_product} explicitly in any of your queries.
    Generate diverse queries covering different aspects such as:
    - Problem-solving queries (e.g., "how to solve X problem")
    - Comparison queries (e.g., "best products for X")
    - Information-seeking queries (e.g., "top-rated solutions for X")
    - Reviews-related queries (e.g., "most reliable X type products")
    
    Format your response as a JSON array of strings containing ONLY the queries.
    Example response format:
    ```json
    ["query 1", "query 2", "query 3"]
    ```
